# Experimental Notebooks

This folder contains exploratory and intermediate notebooks developed during early stages of the project.

These notebooks were primarily used for:
- preliminary testing and prototyping,
- validating ideas and architectural choices,
- developing and refining functions later reused in the main pipelines.

As a result, some notebooks may be incomplete, lack comments, or rely on outdated assumptions. Certain executions may no longer run correctly without modification.

They are included for completeness and transparency, but **are not part of the finalized experimental pipeline** used to produce the results reported in the thesis.
